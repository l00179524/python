i made a new file called as o.py in that file i added the below code to find the most priced items 

sh@ishan-desktop-machine:~$ cat o.py 
def most_expensive(price_list):
    
  
    max_price = 0
    max_price_item = ""
    
    for description, price in price_list:
       
        if price > max_price:
            max_price = price
            max_price_item = description
        
        else:
            pass
    
    return max_price_item, max_price


price_list = [("cherry", 1.0), ("Apples", .5), ("Pears", .7), ("Peaches", .8)]

product, price  = most_expensive(price_list)
print(product, price)

below is the output 


ish@ishan-desktop-machine:~$ python3 o.py 
cherry 1.0
ish@ishan-desktop-machine:~$ 


2nddly i added the availaibility variable also it gave me the below output and name of file is p.py



def most_expensive(price_list):
    
  
    max_price = 0
    max_price_item = ""
    
    for description, price in price_list:
       
        if price > max_price:
            max_price = price
            max_price_item = description
        
        else:
            pass
    
    return max_price_item, max_price


price_list = [("cherry", 1.0), ("Apples", .5), ("Pears", .7), ("Peaches", .8)]

product, price,availability = most_expensive(price_list)
print(product, price,availability)

I got the error since availability variable is not defined in price_list 

ish@ishan-desktop-machine:~$ cat p.py 
def most_expensive(price_list):
    
  
    max_price = 0
    max_price_item = ""
    
    for description, price in price_list:
       
        if price > max_price:
            max_price = price
            max_price_item = description
        
        else:
            pass
    
    return max_price_item, max_price


price_list = [("cherry", 1.0), ("Apples", .5), ("Pears", .7), ("Peaches", .8)]

product, price,availability = most_expensive(price_list)
print(product, price,availability)

ish@ishan-desktop-machine:~$ python3 p.py
