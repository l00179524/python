ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ cat con1.py 
a=True
b=True
c=True

if a:
  print("a was True")
elif b:
  print("b was True")
elif c:
  print("c was True")
else:
  print("no other was true")
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ python3 con1.py 
a was True
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ 



ithen changed the value of a , b,c to false  and got the below output 

ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ cat con1.py 
a=False
b=False
c=False


if a:
  print("a was True")
elif b:
  print("b was True")
elif c:
  print("c was True")
else:
  print("no other was true")
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ python3 con1.py 
no other was true
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ 



Now in the below if else script i am going to use shebang operator 


I used the command which python3 it gave me the patch from where python origanted 

ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ 
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ cat con3.py 
#!/usr/bin/python3
if (3>5) and (9>4):
    print ("yess all is ok")
else:
    print("all is not ok")
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$ ./con3.py -------------------------------->> i executed the script only using ./ as i gave x permission to script 
all is not ok
ish@ish-ubuntudesktop:~$
