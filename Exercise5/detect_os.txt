In this below program we can detect the os where our script is running 

I tested in linux enviornment 

sh@ishan-desktop-machine:~/Exercises_06$ vi scripver.py
ish@ishan-desktop-machine:~/Exercises_06$ python3 scripver.py 
This module is called __main__ and executes as a standalone script
Your system is Linux
ish@ishan-desktop-machine:~/Exercises_06$ cat scripver.py 
import platform 

def detect_os()->str:
    # Detect the OS in use
    return platform.system()


if (__name__ == '__main__'):
    print(f"This module is called {__name__} and executes as a standalone script")
    
    # Check the OS in use, lower case
    my_os = detect_os()
    my_os = my_os.lower()
    
    # Parse the response
    if my_os == "windows":
        print("Your system is Windows")
    elif my_os == "linux":
        print("Your system is Linux")
    elif my_os == "darwin":
        print("Your Apple system is MacOS")
    elif my_os == "cygwin":
        print("Your Apple system is MacOS")
    elif my_os == "aix":
        print("Your IBM system is AIX")
    else:
        print(f"Unidentified system = {my_os}")
else:
    print(f"This module is called {__name__} and is being called by another script")

#############################I now used Upper in place of lower i got below output

    # Check the OS in use, lower case
    my_os = detect_os()
    my_os = my_os.Upper()
    
    # Parse the response
    if my_os == "windows":
        print("Your system is WINDOWS")
    elif my_os == "linux":
        print("Your system is LINUX")
    elif my_os == "darwin":
        print("Your Apple system is MACOS")

    else:
