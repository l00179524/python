The Purpose of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with Python commands and codes by focusing on the automation point of view
So all in one, a total 11 exercises have been created  and the main repository in Github is 'https://github.com/l00179524/python'
Exercise1 to Exercise11 demonstrates different files within it and with respect to various programs also some files are in .txt format 
which also consist of code and output files.
